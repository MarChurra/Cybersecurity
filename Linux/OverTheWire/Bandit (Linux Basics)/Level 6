The password for the next level is stored somewhere on the server and has all of the following properties:

    owned by user bandit7
    owned by group bandit6
    33 bytes in size

The search expanded greatly in this challenge. Manual searching would be nearly impossible or too much time consuming.
The solution to this one required a queried search tot he entire file structure.
I needed to search for files owned by this user and group via the respective flags. 
The only difference is that I also used "2>/dev/null" to hide permission denied files, which would have caused a lot of "noise" on the output.

Technologies used:
    -Powershell
    -SSH
    -Queried Search with Flags
