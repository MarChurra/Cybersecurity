Level Goal

The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt, where all lowercase (a-z) and uppercase (A-Z) letters have been rotated by 13 positions


The string is crypted with ROT13 (each character of the alphabet is rotated by 13 position), so a becomes n, and so on.
Thankfully, Linux already offers a tool, in the shape of tr, that allows us to convert a dataset into another. In this sense, i can specify that i want to translate A-Z into N-Z, with N being the initial character.

Technologies used:
    -Powershell
    -SSH
    -tr
