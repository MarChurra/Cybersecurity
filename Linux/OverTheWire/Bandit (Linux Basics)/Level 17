Level Goal

There are 2 files in the homedirectory: passwords.old and passwords.new. 
The password for the next level is in passwords.new and is the only line that has been changed between passwords.old and passwords.new

Approach:
A much simpler challenge.
If the password is a single change, a single us of diff to compare the two files was enough to reach the password for the next level.

Technologies used:
    -Powershell
    -SSH
    -diff
