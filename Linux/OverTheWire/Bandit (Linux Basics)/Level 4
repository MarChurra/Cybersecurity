This challenge required us to search for the only ASCII Text (Human Readable) file within the inhere directory.

Using ls and Cat was not enough, since there was some trickery involved with the file names. Using file and ./* allowed me to read correctly the type of files. 

Had to use ./* again together with Cat to read the file and get the password.
