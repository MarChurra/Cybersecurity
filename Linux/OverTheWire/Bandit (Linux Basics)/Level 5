The goal was to search several directories for a folder that is not an executable, has 1033 bytes in size and is human readable.

The solution for this one was to chain several commands such as type -f and ! executable, to query the files in the directory.

Technologies used:

        -Powershell

        -SSH

        -cd 

        -ls

        -cat

        -Queries
