This exercise was similiar to the one before. It asked us to find the password inside a file, also located in the home directory.

However, the challenge was with the name of the file, "-".

Attempting to use cat - "froze" the terminal. After looking into it, I realized the terminal was reading the - as the beginning of a "stdin" (Standard Input), which simply activated a mode of the terminal, which awaits from further instructions by the user.

In order to access the file, I had to adjust the path to the file, when using cat.

    Technologies used:

        -Powershell

        -SSH

        -cd 

        -ls / find

        -cat
