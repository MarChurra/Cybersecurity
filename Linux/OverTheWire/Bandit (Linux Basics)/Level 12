Level Goal

The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt, which is a hexdump of a file that has been repeatedly compressed.
For this level it may be useful to create a directory under /tmp in which you can work. Use mkdir with a hard to guess directory name. 
Or better, use the command “mktemp -d”. Then copy the datafile using cp, and rename it using mv (read the manpages!)


Much like an onion, this challenge has several layers to it. The file is heavily compressed, by different levels of compression, all of them with different compression types.
It required a lot of trial and error in order to understand the correct track. Afterwards, i had to keep renaming the files and decompressing them over and over until i reached the ASCII file with the password.
