The games give you several challenges and require the player to crack the puzzle, in order to gain insight or the credentials needed to proceed into the next level.

The first challenge is to connect via SSH to their own platform, utilizing the stated protocol.

As requested by the rules of the games, these notes will state the techologies used and my reasoning behind a solution, however i wont include the complete solution.

For this first exercise, while PUTTY was a viable choice, since I am currently working on a Windows environnement, I decided to connect via SSH to the host via PowerShell, for convinience sake.

Via PowerShell, i had to utilize the CMD SSH, specify the Port, and fill out the remaing information.

For the sake of keeping my stay in the games tidier, I also created a temporary work file in the Temp directory, via the "mktemp -d" command, in order to create a random directory, as advised by the rules.
