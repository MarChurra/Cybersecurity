# Level Goal

The password for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to port 30001 on localhost using SSL/TLS encryption.

Since I already know the password for this game, the approach was to use Openssl in order to sucessfully establish an SSL/TLS connection with the localhost, over the specified port. 

## Technologies used:
    -Powershell
    -SSH
    -Cat
    -Openssl
