# Level Goal

There is a git repository at ssh://bandit27-git@bandit.labs.overthewire.org/home/bandit27-git/repo via the port 2220. The password for the user bandit27-git is the same as for the user bandit27.

From your local machine (not the OverTheWire machine!), clone the repository and find the password for the next level. This needs git installed locally on your machine.

## Approach:
Requires GIT installed on the local computer. A forward level. 

## Solution found
With GIT CMD, all that needs to be done is to use git clone, with the ssh link provided, to copy the repo and see the file with the password. 

## Technologies used:
    -GIT
