-In order to progress, I had to find the password for the next level, hidden within a readme.txt file, located in the home directory of the host machine.

Since I was connected right away to the home directory, using "ls" was enough to find the file. "find" was also a good option to confirm its presence in the directory.

After that using "cat" was enough to read the file name and progress.

    Technologies used:

        -Powershell

        -SSH

        -cd 

        -ls / find

        -cat
