Level Goal

The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt next to the word millionth.

Seems scarier at first, but it can be solved easily with a one liner.

Grep followed with what I am looking for is enough to return me the line in question, where the solution is.

Technologies used:
    -Powershell
    -SSH
    -Grep
