- An host needs an IPv4 address to participate on the internet and almost all LANs today.
- It identifies a particular host and must be properly configured and unique within the LAN, for local communication.
- It must also be proplery configured and unique in the world, for remote communication.

### Octets and Dotted-Decimal Notation
  - IPv4 addresses are 32 bits in length.
  - These are grouped into 8-bit bytes, the octets.
  - These octets are then converted into its decimal value, separated by a decimal point or period.
  - It is divided between the network portion and the host portion.
  - Devices with the same network numbers will be able to communicate. Those in other subnets will require routing to do so.
  - Each phyiscal network can thus be divided into several logical IPv4 networks.
