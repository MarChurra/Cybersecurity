## Network Media Types
### Three Media Types
  - Data is transmitted across a network on media. The media provides the channel over which the message travels from source to destination.
  - Modern network primarily use three types of media to interconnect devices:
    - Copper
    - Fiber-Optic
    - Wireless
  - The criteria to choose a network media are:
    - What is the maximum distance that the media can sucessfully carry a signal?
    - What is the environment in which the media will be installed.
    - What is the amount of data and at what speed must it be transmitted.
    - What is the cost of the media and the installation.
      
### Common Network Cables
  - Twisted-Pair Cable - Ethernet technology generally uses these cables. In twisted-pair, wires are grouped in pairs and twisted together to reduce interference. The pairs are colored so that you can identify the same wire at each end.
  - Coaxial Cable - One of the earliest types of network cables. Is the kind of copper cable used by cable TV companies. It is also used for connecting the various components which make up satellite communication systems. Coaxial cable has a single rigid copper core that conducts the signal. It is surrounded by a layer of insulation, braided metal shielding and a protective jacket. It uses a high-frequency transmission line to carry high-frequency or broadband signals.
  - Fiber-Optic Cable - Can be either glass or plastic with a diameter about the same as a human hair and it can carry digital information at very high speeds over long distances. It uses light instead of electricity.
      - Electrical interference does not affect the signal
      - They have a very high bandwidth.
      - Fiber iis used in backbone networks, large enterprises, large data centers and telephone companies.
