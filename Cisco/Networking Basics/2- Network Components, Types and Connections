-Modern communication works via a Client, that requests information to a Server. Nowadays, its common to have devices that can work as both. 
-All computers connected to a netowrk that participate directly in network communication are classified as hostos. Hosts can send and receive messages on the network.
-In modern networks, computer hosts can act as a client, a server, or both. The software installed on the computer determines the role it plays.
-Server are hosts that have software installed which enable them to provide information to client, like email or web pages, to other hosts on the network.º
-Each service requires separate sever software, For example,a  host requires web server softtware in order to provide web services to the network. Every destination you visit online is provided to you by a server located somewhere on a network that is connected to the internet.
-Clients are computer hosts that have software installed that enables the hosts ot request and display information obtained from a server. Such as a web browser.

    E-mail: Requiores a email server on the server and a mail client software on the client.
    Web: A browser requests via HTTP the web page from a web server.
    File: The file sever stores corporate and user files in a central location. The client devices access thes efiles with client software, such as the Windows File Explorer.

Peer-To-Peer Networks:
    -Client and server software usually run on separate computers, but it is also possible for one computer to run both. this type of network is called a P2P network.
    -The simplest P2P network consists of two directly connected computers using either a wired or wireless connection. Both computers are then able to use this simpel network to exchange data and services with each other, acting aas either a client or a server as necessary.
    -Multiple PCs can also be connected to create a larger P2P network, but this requires a network device, such as a switch, to interconnect the computers.
    -The main disavantage of a P2P environment is that the performance of a host can be slowed down if it is acting as both a client and aserver at the same time.
    -In larger business, due to the volume of data traffic, its normal to ahve dedicated servers.

    Benefits:
        -Easy to setup
        -Less complex
        -Lower cost because network devices and dedicated servers may not be required
        -Can be used for simple tasks such as transferring files and sharing printers

    Disavantages:
        -No centralized administration
        -Not as secure
        -Not scalable
        -All devices may act as both clients and servers which can show performance 

Peer-To-Peer Applications:
    A P2P application allows a device to act as both a client and a server within the same communication.
    In this model, every client is a server and vice-versa. P2P applications require that each end device provide a user interface and run a background service.
    Some of these applications may use a hyubrid system where resource sharing is decentralized, but the indexes that point to resource locations are stored in a centralized directory. In a hybrid system, each peer accesses an index server to get the location of a resource stored in a peer.

The network infrastructure contains three categories of hardware components:
    -End Devices (Desktops, Laptops, Printers...)
    -Intermediate Devices (Router, Switch, Fiirewall Appliance)
    -Network Media  (Wireless Media, LAN Media, WAN Media )

ISP Services:
    -An Internet Service Provider provides the link between the home network and the internet. An ISP can be the local cable provider, a landline telephone service provider, the celluar network that provides your smartphone service, or an independent provider who leases bandiwth on the physical network infrastructure of another company.    
    -Thjey are critical to communications across the global internet. Each ISP connects to other ISPs to form a network of links that interconnect users all over the world. ISPs are connected in a hierarchical manner that ensures that internet traffic generally takes the shortest path from source to destination.
    -The primary medium that connects the internet backbone is fiber-optic cable. Typicaly installed underground to connect cities within continents. They can also run under the sea to connect countries and continents.
    -A router is required to securely connect a computer to an ISP. This is the most common connection option. It consists of using a wireless integrated router to connect to the ISP. The router includes a switch to connect wired hosts and a wireless AP to connect wireless hosts. The router also provides client IP addressing information and security for inside hosts.
    -Most home networks do not connect to an ISP weith fiber-optic cables. They usually use:
        -Cable (Offered by cable television service providers, the internet data signal is carried on the same coaxial cable that deliverts cable television. It provides a high bandwith, always on, connection to the internet. A special calbe modem separates the internet data signal from the other signals.)
        -DSL (A Digital Subscriber Line provdes a high banwidth, always on, connection to the internet. It requires a high-speed modem that separates the DSL signal from the telephone one. It runs over a telephone line with the line split into three channels. One for voice calls, a second is a download channel and the third is used for sending and uploading information.)
        -Cellular (Uses a cell phone network to connect.)
        -Satellite (Require a clear line of sigth to the satellite, its a wireless connection to the satellite.)
        -Dial-up Telephone (Uses any phone line and a modem.)
