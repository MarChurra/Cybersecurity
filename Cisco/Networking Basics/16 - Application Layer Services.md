## The Client Server Relationship
- Web Resources and web services such as RESTful APIs are identified using a Uniform Resource Identifier **URI**.
- A URI is a string of characters that identifies a specific network resource, it has two specializations:
  - Uniform Resource Name **URN** - This identifies only the namespace of the resource without reference to the protocol
  - Uniform Resource Locator **URL** - This defines the network location of a specific resource on the network. It can be HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SFTP, SSH.
- Parts of a URI:
  - Protocol/scheme
  - Hostname
  - Path and Filename
  - Fragment
