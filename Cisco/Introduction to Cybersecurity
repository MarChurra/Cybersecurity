  What is Cybersecurity?

    -The ongoing effort to protect individuals, organizations and governments from digital attacks by protecting networked systems and data from unauthorized use or harm.

    There are two types of Organizational Data:

      -Traditional Data: Such as Transactional Data, Intelectual Property, Financial Data

      -Internet of Things and Big Data


  The McCumber Cube:

      -It´s a model framework created in 1991, that helps organizations establish and evaluate information security initiatives by considering all of the related factors that impact them. This security model has three dimensions:

          1. The foundational principles for protecting information systems (Confidentiality, Integrity & Availability )
          2. The protection of information in each of its possible states. (Processing, Storage, Transmission)
          3. The security measures used to protect data. (Awareness, training and education, Technology, Policy and Procedure)


  Type of Cyber Attackers:
    
          1. White Hat (break into networks or computer systems to identify weaknesses, and are done with prior permission, with reported results back to the owner)
          2. Gray Hat (Can set out to find vulnerabilities in a system but they will only report their findings if doing so coincides with their agenda. Or they might even publish details about the vuilnerability on the internet so that other attackers can exploit it.)
          3. Black Hat (Take advantage of known vulnerabilities for ilegal personal, financial or political gain)

      They can be:

          1. Amateurs (script kiddies)
          2. Hackers 
          3. Organized Hackers (cyber criminals, hacktivists, terrorists and state-sponsored hackers)


  Cyberwarfare: The use of technology to penetrate and attack another nation´s network and systems, in an effort to cause damage or disurption.
                Its main purpose is to gain advantage over advesaries, wheter they are nations or competitors.

                    -Gathers information and defense secrets
                    -To impact another nation´s infrastructure

  
  Malware: Malicious software, which is any piece of code that can be used to steal data, bypass access controls, or cause harm to or compromise a system. Knowing what the different types are and how they speard is key to containing and removing them.

  Types of Malware:

      -Spyware (Designed to track and spy a user online activity. Often bundled with legitimate software or Trojan Horses.)

      -Adware (Often installed with some versions of software and is designed to automatically deliver advertisements to a user, most often on a web browser. Often comes with spyware.)

      -Backdoor (Used to gain unauthorized access by bypassing the normal authentication procedures to access a system. Hackers can gain remote access to resources within an application and issue remote system commands. Works in the background as difficult to detect.)

      -Ransomware (Designed to hold a system or the data it contains captive, until a payment is made. It usually works by encrypting your data so that you can´t access it. usually comes with phising emails or via a software vulnerability.)

      - Scareware (Uses scare tactis to trick you into taking a specific action. Scareware mainly consists of opearting system style windows that pop up to warn you that your system is at risk and needs to run a specific program for it to reutrn to normal, which is the infected software.)

      -Rootkit (Designed to modify the operating system to create a backdoor, for attackers to gain access to a computer remotely. They take advantage of software vulnerabilities to gain access to resources with privilege escalation, and modify system files.)

      -Virus (A type of computer program that, when executed, replicates and attaches itself to othe executable files, such as a document, by inserting its own code. Most of them require end-user interaction to initiate activation and can be written to act on a specific date or time.)

      -Trojan Horse (Malware that carries out malicious operations by masking its true intent. It might appear legitimate but is, in fact, very dangerous. Exploits user privileges and are most ofen found in image files, audio file or games. They do not self-replicate but act as a decoy to sneak malicious software past users)

      - Worms (A type of malware that replicates itself in order to spread from one computer to another. Unlike a virus, which requires an host program to run, worms run by themselves. Other than the initial infection of the host, they do not require user input and can spread quickly over the network. They exploit system vulnerabilities, have a way to propagate themselves and they all contain malicious codes, a payload, that causes damage to computer systems or networks.)


  Symptoms of Malware:

      -An abnormal increase in the CPU load

      -Computer freezing or crashing often

      -decrease in web browsing speed

      -Unexplainable problems with your network connections

      -Modified or deleted files

      -The presence of unknown files, programs or desktop icons

      -Strange unknown processes running

      - Programs turning off or reconfiguring themselves

      - Emails being sent without your knowledge or consent


Methods of Infiltration:

        Social Engineering: The manipulation of people into performing actions or divulding confidential information. They often rely on people´s willingess to be helpful, but they also prey on their weaknesses. For example, an attacked will call an authorized employee with an urgent problem that requires immediate network access and appeal to his vanity or greed, or invoke authority by using name-dropping techniques, in order to gain access.
                            
        Denial-of-Service: These attacks are a type of netowrk attach that is relatively simple to carry out, even by an unskilled attacked. A DoS attack results in some sort of interruption of network service to users, devices or applications.

                                -Overwhemling quanity of traffic.
                                -Maliciously formatted packets.

        Distributed DoS: A similiar to a DoS attack but originates from multiple, coordinated sources. For example:
                         An attacker builds a network (botnet) of infected hosts called zombies, which are controlled by handler systems.
                         The zombie computers will constantly scan and infect more hosts, creating more and more zombies.
                         When ready, the hacker will intrusct the handler systems to make the botnet of zombies carry out a DDoS attack.

      Botnet: A bot computer is typically infected by visiting an unsafe website or opening an infected email attachment or infected media file. A botnet is a group of bots, connected through the internet, that can be controlled by a malicious individual or group.
              It can be hundreds or thousands, ro even more, of bots, that are typically controlled through a command and control server.
              These bots can be activated to distribute malware, launch DDoS attacks, distribute spam email, or execute brute-force password attacks.
              Many organizations, like Cisco, force network activities through botnet traffic filters, to identify any botnet locations.


      On-Path Attacks: On-path attackers intercept or modify communications between two devices, such as a web  browser and a web server, either to collect information from or to impersonate one of the devices.
                       This type of attack is also referred to as aa man-in-the-middle or man-in-the-mobile attack.

      Wi-Fi Password Cracking: 

      Password Attacks: Entering a username and password is one of the most popular forms of authenticated to a web site. Attackers try to uncover a password in order to gain access.

                              -Password spraying:Sprays a few commonly used paswords across a large number of accounts. 

                              -Dictionary attacks: A hacker systematically tries every word in a dictionary or a list of commonly used words as a password in an attempt to break into a password-protected account.

                              -Brute-Force Attacks: The simplest and most commonly used way of gaining access to a password-protected site, brute-force attacks see an attacked using all possible combinations of letters, numbers and symbols in the password space until they get it right.

                              -Rainbow Attacks: Passwords in a computer system are not stored as a plain text, but as hashed values. A rainbow table is a large dictionary of precomputed hashes and the passwords from which they were calculated. This attack compares the hash of a password with those stored in the rainbow table. If a match is found, they identify the password used to create the hash.

                              -Traffic Interception: Plain text or unecrypted passwords can be easily read by other humans and machines by intercepting communications. If you store a password in a clear, readable text, anyone who has access can read it.

    Cracking Times:

    Advanced Persistent Threaths: Attackers also achieve infiltration through advanced persistent Threats (APTs) - a multi-phase, long term, stealthy and advanced operation against a specifig target. For these reasons, an individual attacker often lacks the skill set, resources or persistence to perform APTs.


    Security Vulnerability and Exploits:

        -Security vulnerabilities are any kind of software or hardware defect. A program written to take advantage of a known vulnerability is referred to as an exploit. These exploits can be used to carryy out an attack, with the goal of gaining access to a system, the data it hosts, or a specific resource.

        Hardware Vulnerabilities: Most often result of hardware design flaws. They are specific to device models and are not generally eploited through random compromising attempts. They are commonly highly targeted attacks, however, traditional malware protection and good physical security are a sufficient protection for the everyday user.

  Software Vulnerabilities:

        -They are usually introducted by errors in the operating system or application code. 

Software Vulnerabilities Categories:

        -Buffer Overflow: Buffers are memory areas allocated to an application. A vulnerability occurs when data is written beyond the limits of a buffer. By chaing data beyond these boundaries, the application can access memory allocated to other processes. This can lead to a system crash or data compromised, or provide escalation of priviliges.

        - Non-validaded input: Programs often require data input, but this incoming data could have malicious content, designed to force the program to behave in an unintended way.

        -Race Conditions: This vulnerability describes a situation where the output of an event depends on ordered or timed outputs. A race condition becomes a source of vulnerability when the required ordered or timed events do not occur in the correct order. 

        - Weaknesses in secuirty practices: System and sensitive data can be protected through techniques such as authentication, authorization and encryption. 

        Access control problems: The process of controlling who does what and ranges from managing physical access to equipment to dictating who has access to a resouce, such as a file, and what they can do with it, such as read or edit. 

Software Updates:

      The goal of these updates is to stay current and avoid exploitation of vulnerabilities. Patches are released by the main manufacturers almost every day and applications such as browsers, mobile apps and web servers, are often updated by their companies.


Cybersecurity Devices and technologies:

    -Routers

    -Firewalls (Designed to control or filter which communications are allowed in and which are allowed out of a device or a network. It can be a host based firewall or a standalone network device that protects an entire network of computers.)

          -Network Layer Firewall (Filters commuincations based on source and destination IP addresses.)

          -Transporte Layer Firewall (Filters commuincations based on source and destination data ports, as well as connection states.)

          -Application Layer Firewall (Filters Communications based on an application, program or service.)

          - Context Aware layer Firewall (Filters communications based on the user device, role, application type and threat profile.)

          -Proxy Server (Filters web content requests like URLs, domain names and media types)

          - Reverse Proxy Server (Placed in front of web servers, these protect, hide, offload and distribute access to web servers.)

          -Netowrk address translation (NAT) Firewall - This firewall hides or masquerades the private addresses of network hosts.

          -Host-based Firewall (Filter ports and system service calls on a single computer)

    -VPNs

    -Antivimalware softwares

    -IPS (Intrusion Prevention Systems)
