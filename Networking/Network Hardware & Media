Network Media: THe method or medium, from which data will be transmitted between nodes. Can be classificed according to the hardware or technology used.

Bounded Network Media: Actual physical media. Cooper and fiber optics cables are an example.
                      Utilizes a physical conductor such as a metal wire or a glass or plastic core cable.

Copper Media: Either a single copper core, or made up of twisted pairs of copper strands.
              Electromagnetic media.
              Most common implementations are Coaxial (Coax) Cable and Twisted Pair Cable (such as a ethernet cable, which uses RJ-45 connection for data).
              Has a Foil shielded by a plastic cover, that stops from EMI, disruptions to the signals being passed.

Wiring Standards:

              -T568/A (Less used) 
  
              -T568/B              

STP AND UTP CABLE:

            -Shielded Twisted Pair Cabling: Twisted Pair copper cabling that has a metal foil, or braided shielding surrounding the pairs. Decreates the susceptilibty of EMI.
            More expensive than UTP and harder to workt with.

            -Unshielded Twisted Pair Cabling: Does not have any protective metal coating. Very susceptible to EMI.
                                              Less expensive and easier to work with.

Twisted Pair Cabling Categories:

            -Cat: Category

            -CAT1: Voice only, outdaded.

            -CAT2: Rare today. Token based networks only. Outdaded.

            -CAT3: Ethernet 10MBps. Voice Traffic. Estabilished by TIA/EIA

            -CAT4: Surpseded by CAT5. Rarely used

            -CAT5: Fast ethernet, up to 100MBps, 100Mhz. frequency. 

            -CAT5e: 100Mhz Frequency. Addressed CrossTalk Issues, goes up to 350MBPs. 

            -Cat6: Gigabit Ethernet 1GBPs Data Rate 200-250MHz

            -CAT6A: Augmented Cat6. Greater than 1GBPs - 10GBPS 500MHZ 

            -CAT7: 10Gigabit Ethernet. Upwards of 10GBPS+ speeds. 600MHZ

            -All Cables have a Max Cable Length of 100 Meters, from Cat3 to Cat7 


Coaxial Cabling: Single Copper Core, covered by a Non-Conductive Insulated Coating, covered by a Braided Metal Shielding of Cooper or Steel, defending from EMI and letting him be Grounded. Covered by  Outer Plastic Sheating.

Coax Cable Types:

            -RG58/U -- Ethernet, Solid Core, 50 ohms impedance - 5mm
