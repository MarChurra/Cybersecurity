Network Media: THe method or medium, from which data will be transmitted between nodes. Can be classificed according to the hardware or technology used.

Bounded Network Media: Actual physical media. Cooper and fiber optics cables are an example.
                      Utilizes a physical conductor such as a metal wire or a glass or plastic core cable.

Copper Media: Either a single copper core, or made up of twisted pairs of copper strands.
              Electromagnetic media.
              Most common implementations are Coaxial (Coax) Cable and Twisted Pair Cable (such as a ethernet cable, which uses RJ-45 connection for data).
              Has a Foil shielded by a plastic cover, that stops from EMI, disruptions to the signals being passed.

Wiring Standards:

              -T568/A (Less used. older standard used for data, voice and video) 
  
              -T568/B (Earlier standard including STP and UTP performance minimums as well as Fiber Optics standard. Portions of it are now obsolete.)             
  
              -T568&/C (Current Standard manimum for optimizing network media performance in commercial buildings. Specifies Cat6a as the media type recommended)

STP AND UTP CABLE:

            -Shielded Twisted Pair Cabling: Twisted Pair copper cabling that has a metal foil, or braided shielding surrounding the pairs. Decreates the susceptilibty of EMI.
            More expensive than UTP and harder to workt with.

            -Unshielded Twisted Pair Cabling: Does not have any protective metal coating. Very susceptible to EMI.
                                              Less expensive and easier to work with.

            -RG6 - Cable TV signal routing - 75 ohms registers

Coaxial Cables require the terminators to terminate the connection, such as in an Linear Bus Topology.


Coax Connector Types:

  -T-connector and Terminator

  -Terminator


Fiber Optic Cabling:

    -Composed of a inner strengthening rod. Outside there is filler material. At the center of these strands, there is the Fiber core, either glass or plastic between 5 and 100 microns in diameter. Color coded buffer surrounding the core cladding.
     Covered by Strengthening FIbers, typically made of strong materials, like Kevlar. The outside is protected by a Jacket.

Fiber Modes:

    Single Mode Fiber: Single beam of lght can pass through the core. 30Mhz Bandiwth,m Modulated in intensity to transmit data.(Good for longer distances, but shorter speed)

    Step-Index-Multimode Fiber: Cladding changes the speed and velocity of the light travelling through the medium. When the velocity changes, it is called a stepdown. (short distances, but faster speed).

    Graded-Index Multimode Fiber:_ Up to 2Ghz in bandwidth.
